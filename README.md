# esperimentative-idiot

esperimentative-idiot is a throwaway repository to get a first step in the
world of [zephyr].

It primarily intends to build a firmware to run on an [ESP32-WROOM-32E] board
and/or the QEMU Tensilica Xtensa system emulator.

## BUILD AND FLASH

Build the application from the source tree:

	west build -b esp32 esperimentative-idiot/app/

And flash the firmware down to the device:

	west flash

## PREREQUISITE

### CMAKE PACKAGE

Install the Zephyr [CMake package] using [west] `zephyr-export`:

	west zephyr-export

### TOOLCHAIN

Install the [toolchain] by extracting the archive to the home directory
`~/.espressif/tools/zephyr`.

Example on Linux x86_64:

	mkdir -p ~/.espressif/tools/zephyr
	curl -s https://dl.espressif.com/dl/xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc8_4_0-esp-2020r3-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvzf - -C ~/.espressif/tools/zephyr

### BLOBS

Download the blobs:

	west blobs fetch

### SHELL COMPLETION (OPTIONAL)

Eventually, install the [shell completion] script using [west] `completion`,
and relog then (or `source ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/west`).

Example for bash:

	mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
	west completion bash >~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/west
